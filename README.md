# Word-Game-with-React

This is a game I created with the stack below which is played with a microphone. The rules are simple. After the computer gives you a name you should
follow up with another name that starts with the last letter of the name that computer gave you. If you fail to come up with a name under the given time
or say a name that was already picked or say a name that doesn't start with the last letter of the name computer gave you lose.

Stack:

- Typescript
- NextJS

## Requirements
- node

## Fetch dependencies

```
cd wordgame
npm i
```

## Launch the game

```
cd wordgame
npm run dev
```

The game will be available under `localhost:3000`.
